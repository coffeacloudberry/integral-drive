## How to Create a Release?

Docker is required. It is used to compile the application and build packages for recent as well as older distributions. Run the Docker daemon and `make release`.

The [RPMs](https://rpm-packaging-guide.github.io/) are built with [cargo-rpm](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-rpm) and target Fedora. The DEB is built with [cargo-deb](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-deb) and targets Debian (Ubuntu is based on Debian).
